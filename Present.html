        <p><h1>Simple Website</h1>
       <p>This is a basic understanding of a simple website.</p>
       <h2>What is a website?</h2>
        <p>A website is a collection of web pages and related content that is hosted on a web server and can be accessed over the internet.</p>
        <p>Websites are typically designed for a specific purpose, such as providing information about a company or organization, selling products or services online, or sharing personal interests or opinions.</p>
        <h2>How does a website work?</h2>
        <p>Websites work by using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to provide content and services to users over the internet. Here is a high-level overview of how websites work:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A user enters a website's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into their browser, or clicks on a link to the website from another page.</li>
            <li>The browser sends a request to the website's server, which is hosted on a remote computer. This request includes information about the user's browser, operating system, and other details.</li>
            <li>The server receives the request and retrieves the necessary files and data to generate the requested web page. This data may come from a database, API, or other sources.</li>
            <li>The server generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that make up the web page, based on the data it has retrieved.</li>
            <li>The server sends the completed web page back to the user's browser, which displays it on the screen.</li>
            <li>The server sends the completed web page back to the user's browser, which displays it on the screen.</li>
            <li>If the user submits any information, such as a form or search query, the browser sends this information back to the server, which processes it and generates a new web page or response.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This process continues as the user navigates through the website, interacting with its content and features. The website may also use cookies or other technologies to store information about the user's preferences and behavior, which can be used to personalize their experience and provide better service.</p>
        <h2>What does a website consist of ?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Domain name: The domain name is the web address that people type in to access the website, such as www.example.com. It is a unique identifier for the website.</li>
            <li>Web hosting: Web hosting is the service that stores the website files and makes them accessible to users over the internet. The hosting service may be provided by a third-party company, or the website owner may host their own website on their own server.</li>
            <li>Web pages: Web pages are the individual pages that make up a website. They are created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and may include images, videos, and other media.</li>
            <li>Content management system (CMS): A CMS is a software platform that allows website owners to create and manage their website content without needing to know how to code. Examples of popular CMS platforms include WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla.</li>
            <li>Design and layout: The design and layout of a website includes elements such as color schemes, typography, and page structure. These are important for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website.</li>
            <li>Functionality: Functionality refers to the features and capabilities of the website, such as contact forms, e-commerce functionality, or social media integration. These features are usually implemented using programming languages such as JavaScript and PHP.</li>
            <li>Security: Security measures such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption and firewalls are important for protecting the website and its users from cyber threats such as hacking and data breaches.</li>
            <li>Analytics: Analytics tools allow website owners to track website traffic, user behavior, and other important metrics. This information can be used to optimize the website for better performance and user experience.</li>
        </ul>
